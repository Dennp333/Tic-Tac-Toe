# Tic-Tac-Toe
A tic-tac-toe engine!
To play, first choose to play as X or O.
Then, to make moves, input the coordinate for the square you wish to place an X/O.
The board uses a chess coordinate system (assuming you're white). So the bottom left corner is a1, the middle is b2, the top right corner is c3, etc.
